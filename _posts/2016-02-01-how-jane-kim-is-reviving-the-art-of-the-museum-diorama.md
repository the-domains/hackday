description: "Jane Kim was nearing the end of a science illustration internship at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 2011-honing her ornithology drawing skills-when John Fitzpatrick, the lab's director, showed her a blank 3,000-square-foot, four-story-high wall in the lab's visitor center. \"That wall has been screaming to be a mural since we moved in\" eight years earlier, Fitzpatrick told Kim."
