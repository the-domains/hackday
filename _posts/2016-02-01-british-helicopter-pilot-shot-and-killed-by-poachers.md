description: "When gunshots rang out in the Maswa Game Reserve, a protected area bordering Tanzania's famous Serengeti National Park, on Thursday, January 28, a ground patrol unit from the Friedkin Conservation Fund was called to investigate. The team trekked through thick bush until the next morning, when they radioed for air support to help locate the suspected poachers."
